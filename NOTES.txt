challenges:
doing the 30 min aggregates in 1 min sheets(issues: it's including 1 above row in hl, some values are 0) DONE
not messing up data filling
highlighting 9:25 close DONE
NO FORMAT FOR SOME SHARES IN 30 MINS DONE

WHAT IF THERE'S ERROR IN THE RAW DATA:
no 9:25 close DONE
THE 9:25 ROW IS NOT ROW 11 BUT LESS THAN THAT (loop from time start and check when time >= 9:25 and use that row as start row, highlight that close) DONE
