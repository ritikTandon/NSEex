challenges:
doing the 30 min aggregates in 1 min sheets(issues: it's including 1 above row in hl, some values are 0) DONE
not messing up data filling
highlighting 9:25 close DONE
NO FORMAT FOR SOME SHARES IN 30 MINS DONE

WHAT IF THERE'S ERROR IN THE RAW DATA:
no 9:25 close DONE
THE 9:25 ROW IS NOT ROW 11 BUT LESS THAN THAT (loop from time start and check when time >= 9:25 and use that row as start row, highlight that close) DONE


Sonia work notes:
highlight 9:40 row
check if close can be taken from 1 min
take h,l,c,v data from daily api and 9:40 cl from 1 min and correct high and low from 1 minute sheet calculation
do all high and low calc in pandas df itself and not in Excel (its way easier this way)
doing 30 min aggregate in 1 min sheets


Data extraction from nest trader:
positioning the mouse and clicking
adding correct share names and making sure the share is saved in the correct place (select today's appropriate folder at the start of each(1 min, 30 min, etc))
2 ESC after saving and down arrow(if i(counter variable of share name loop) is equal to last length of the share list, move to next section(fo, 30 min, etc))
maximizing first file and saving and closing.
closing share excel file after each save then ESC ESC
waiting appropriate times in between shares and tabs
check for change in pixel color using screenshot functionality of pyautogui and click accordingly: while (x, y) is not desired_color:

-> AFTER FIRST ITERATION OF EVERY SECTION, JUST DO -> CTRL+SHIFT+H -> ENTER -> SAVING PROCEDURE

-> MAKE SEPARATE DICTS FOR SEPARATE WINDOW COORDINATES

-> MAKE A SAVING FUNCTION TO AVOID CODE REPETITION

-> def save(name, path=''):
    if path != '':
        click the path box, enter correct path and press enter or whatever

    save as usual

TRY CLOSING EXCEL AFTER 4-5 EXCEL SHEETS, SAVING US TIME(11:30 PM 25/8/23 CURENTLY NOT WORKING BECAUSE PC HAS BEEN ON FOR
LONG AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, GENERATED EXCEL SHEETS OPEN IN THE FOREGROUND, INSTEAD OF THE BACKGROUND)
