challenges:
doing the 30 min aggregates in 1 min sheets(issues: it's including 1 above row in hl, some values are 0) DONE
not messing up data filling
highlighting 9:25 close DONE
NO FORMAT FOR SOME SHARES IN 30 MINS DONE

WHAT IF THERE'S ERROR IN THE RAW DATA:
no 9:25 close DONE
THE 9:25 ROW IS NOT ROW 11 BUT LESS THAN THAT (loop from time start and check when time >= 9:25 and use that row as start row, highlight that close) DONE


Sonia work notes:
highlight 9:40 row
check if close can be taken from 1 min
take h,l,c,v data from daily api and 9:40 cl from 1 min and correct high and low from 1 minute sheet calculation
do all high and low calc in pandas df itself and not in Excel (its way easier this way)
doing 30 min aggregate in 1 min sheets
