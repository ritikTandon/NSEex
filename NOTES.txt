# todo add multithreading to cash close extraction

challenges:
doing the 30 min aggregates in 1 min sheets(issues: it's including 1 above row in hl, some values are 0) DONE
not messing up data filling
highlighting 9:25 close DONE
NO FORMAT FOR SOME SHARES IN 30 MINS DONE

WHAT IF THERE'S ERROR IN THE RAW DATA:
no 9:25 close DONE
THE 9:25 ROW IS NOT ROW 11 BUT LESS THAN THAT (loop from time start and check when time >= 9:25 and use that row as start row, highlight that close) DONE

-> make it so that if a cash share's close is '', add the share name to a manual_write list and print it in the end so I
know which share to manually fill, instead of scanning through all the shares manually


Sonia work notes:
highlight 9:40 row
check if close can be taken from 1 min
take h,l,c,v data from daily api and 9:40 cl from 1 min and correct high and low from 1 minute sheet calculation
do all high and low calc in pandas df itself and not in Excel (its way easier this way)
doing 30 min aggregate in 1 min sheets


Data extraction from nest trader:
positioning the mouse and clicking
adding correct share names and making sure the share is saved in the correct place (select today's appropriate folder at the start of each(1 min, 30 min, etc))
2 ESC after saving and down arrow(if i(counter variable of share name loop) is equal to last length of the share list, move to next section(fo, 30 min, etc))
maximizing first file and saving and closing.
closing share excel file after each save then ESC ESC
waiting appropriate times in between shares and tabs
check for change in pixel color using screenshot functionality of pyautogui and click accordingly: while (x, y) is not desired_color:

-> AFTER FIRST ITERATION OF EVERY SECTION, JUST DO -> CTRL+SHIFT+H -> ENTER -> SAVING PROCEDURE

-> MAKE SEPARATE DICTS FOR SEPARATE WINDOW COORDINATES

-> MAKE A SAVING FUNCTION TO AVOID CODE REPETITION

-> def save(name, path=''):
    if path != '':
        click the path box, enter correct path and press enter or whatever

    save as usual

==> CHALLENGES
expiry day
next day of expiry
TRY CLOSING EXCEL AFTER 4-5 EXCEL SHEETS, SAVING US TIME(11:30 PM 25/8/23 CURRENTLY NOT WORKING BECAUSE PC HAS BEEN ON FOR
LONG AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, GENERATED EXCEL SHEETS OPEN IN THE FOREGROUND, INSTEAD OF THE BACKGROUND)

USE A EVENT LISTENER LIB TO DETECT THE PRESS OF A PAUSE BUTTON AND RUN AN input() command to pause execution
PUT THE MOUSE BACK WHERE IT WAS BEFORE UNPAUSING


NOTES ABOUT WEEK DATA AUTOMATION:
USE LIST OF WEEKLY END ROWS AND INCREMENT THAT EVERY WEEK
KEEP A WEEK_LENGTH VARIABLE IN CASE IT'S A 4/3-DAY WEEK

ADD CSH30, FO1 and CSH excel automation


TRADING ALG NOTES:
to keep prev date, save old date variables in file and at the end of the program, update these variables in .txt file

1. open current date and format
2 next day, first format current day's sheet and then look for each share in prev day if we enter a buy or sell, write that
to sheet 2 in prev day. Calculate if we reached tgt or sl. If neither, keep empty. depending on buy or sell, calculate the

Note: round off share prices to 0.05 up(buy entry, buy sl) and down(sell entry, sell sl) and down (buy tgt) and up(sell tgt) // confirm these with papa
Note: dynamic rows( change 135 to a dynamic var)

ADDING FREE PANES TO ALL ! MIN SHEETS

not enter trades after 2:55 (done)
todo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! make sure all 1 min sheets are fully forming

DAILY DATA WORK OVERHAUL AND 150 SHARE DAILY DATA + ACTUAL ALGO TRADE REPORT SHEET

DAILY DATA:
    todo seperate the 1 min sheet generation and the close generation as I have to regenerate 1 min whenever there's error in close value taking from NSE
    !!!!!!!!!!!!! add a input() current date and prev date read so I know all is good !!!!!!!!!!!!!
    add NTPC and HINDALCO in 30 min
    @-adding and removing shares papa asked for
    -Improving daily data code
    @-automatically saving csh, csh30 and fo1 and converting them
    -todo automatically saving weekly, monthly and closing data along with making scripts to save monthly and closing data
    -waiting for fo bhav copy using try-except (if file not present, wait code execution via input()/ makes sound to indicate file not present and when file is present,
    take input from user and auto extract file)
    @-convert name, row lists to dicts
    -appropriate code commenting
    -more function based code(cleaner code)
    -TODO put all files in one so that easy for raghav to execute
    -weekly flag to ensure the weekly code isn't being run when it shouldn't

150 SHARE DATA AND ALGO:
    - increase fonts and bold cash bhav copy shares
    - ************* @todo 27 jan - 1 feb 2020 is 6-day week instead of 5 for weekly****************************
    - ************* @todo some repeated columns in 2020 ****************************
    @-ensuring the 1-min files are being properly made
    @-creating separate 1 min and daily data for these 150 shares
    @-format 1 min and take the csh150 file and take close from nse site and save data.
    -create script to save weekly data from start to end
    @-FIND A WAY TO AUTOMATE CREATION OF SHEETS FOR THE FIRST TIME AS THAT'S THE MOST TIME CONSUMING PROCESS(pandas???)
    -after data is made, do the checking of previous day to see what actual trades happened or not(use less confusing names)


todo:   running order
nest trader till all shares are properly saved
download fo and cash bhavcopy
cash - algo - fo (concurrent)
30 min cash
cash bhavcopy
data feed(todo don't forget to increment daily offset and weekly offset and weekly, monthly or closing flags)
changing date variables
