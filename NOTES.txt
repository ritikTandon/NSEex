# todo add multithreading to cash close extraction
# todo when loading took too much time in cash, program terminates without saving as close list doesnt have same no of shares as cash close list, add something in the exception block to fix this
challenges:
doing the 30 min aggregates in 1 min sheets(issues: it's including 1 above row in hl, some values are 0) DONE
not messing up data filling
highlighting 9:25 close DONE
NO FORMAT FOR SOME SHARES IN 30 MINS DONE

WHAT IF THERE'S ERROR IN THE RAW DATA:
no 9:25 close DONE
THE 9:25 ROW IS NOT ROW 11 BUT LESS THAN THAT (loop from time start and check when time >= 9:25 and use that row as start row, highlight that close) DONE

-> make it so that if a cash share's close is '', add the share name to a manual_write list and print it in the end so I
know which share to manually fill, instead of scanning through all the shares manually


Sonia work notes:
highlight 9:40 row
check if close can be taken from 1 min
take h,l,c,v data from daily api and 9:40 cl from 1 min and correct high and low from 1 minute sheet calculation
do all high and low calc in pandas df itself and not in Excel (its way easier this way)
doing 30 min aggregate in 1 min sheets


Data extraction from nest trader:
positioning the mouse and clicking
adding correct share names and making sure the share is saved in the correct place (select today's appropriate folder at the start of each(1 min, 30 min, etc))
2 ESC after saving and down arrow(if i(counter variable of share name loop) is equal to last length of the share list, move to next section(fo, 30 min, etc))
maximizing first file and saving and closing.
closing share excel file after each save then ESC ESC
waiting appropriate times in between shares and tabs
check for change in pixel color using screenshot functionality of pyautogui and click accordingly: while (x, y) is not desired_color:

-> AFTER FIRST ITERATION OF EVERY SECTION, JUST DO -> CTRL+SHIFT+H -> ENTER -> SAVING PROCEDURE

-> MAKE SEPARATE DICTS FOR SEPARATE WINDOW COORDINATES

-> MAKE A SAVING FUNCTION TO AVOID CODE REPETITION

-> def save(name, path=''):
    if path != '':
        click the path box, enter correct path and press enter or whatever

    save as usual

==> CHALLENGES
expiry day
next day of expiry
TRY CLOSING EXCEL AFTER 4-5 EXCEL SHEETS, SAVING US TIME(11:30 PM 25/8/23 CURRENTLY NOT WORKING BECAUSE PC HAS BEEN ON FOR
LONG AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, GENERATED EXCEL SHEETS OPEN IN THE FOREGROUND, INSTEAD OF THE BACKGROUND)

USE A EVENT LISTENER LIB TO DETECT THE PRESS OF A PAUSE BUTTON AND RUN AN input() command to pause execution
PUT THE MOUSE BACK WHERE IT WAS BEFORE UNPAUSING


NOTES ABOUT WEEK DATA AUTOMATION:
USE LIST OF WEEKLY END ROWS AND INCREMENT THAT EVERY WEEK
KEEP A WEEK_LENGTH VARIABLE IN CASE IT'S A 4/3-DAY WEEK

ADD CSH30, FO1 and CSH excel automation


TRADING ALG NOTES:
to keep prev date, save old date variables in file and at the end of the program, update these variables in .txt file

1. open current date and format
2 next day, first format current day's sheet and then look for each share in prev day if we enter a buy or sell, write that
to sheet 2 in prev day. Calculate if we reached tgt or sl. If neither, keep empty. depending on buy or sell, calculate the

Note: round off share prices to 0.05 up(buy entry, buy sl) and down(sell entry, sell sl) and down (buy tgt) and up(sell tgt) // confirm these with papa
Note: dynamic rows( change 135 to a dynamic var)

ADDING FREE PANES TO ALL ! MIN SHEETS

not enter trades after 2:55 (done)
todo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! make sure all 1 min sheets are fully forming

DAILY DATA WORK OVERHAUL AND 150 SHARE DAILY DATA + ACTUAL ALGO TRADE REPORT SHEET

DAILY DATA:
    todo seperate the 1 min sheet generation and the close generation as I have to regenerate 1 min whenever there's error in close value taking from NSE
    !!!!!!!!!!!!! add a input() current date and prev date read so I know all is good !!!!!!!!!!!!!
    add NTPC and HINDALCO in 30 min
    @-adding and removing shares papa asked for
    -Improving daily data code
    @-automatically saving csh, csh30 and fo1 and converting them
    -todo automatically saving weekly, monthly and closing data along with making scripts to save monthly and closing data
    -waiting for fo bhav copy using try-except (if file not present, wait code execution via input()/ makes sound to indicate file not present and when file is present,
    take input from user and auto extract file)
    @-convert name, row lists to dicts
    -appropriate code commenting
    -more function based code(cleaner code)
    -TODO put all files in one so that easy for raghav to execute
    -weekly flag to ensure the weekly code isn't being run when it shouldn't

150 SHARE DATA AND ALGO:
    - increase fonts and bold cash bhav copy shares
    - ************* @todo 27 jan - 1 feb 2020 is 6-day week instead of 5 for weekly****************************
    - ************* @todo some repeated columns in 2020 ****************************
    @-ensuring the 1-min files are being properly made
    @-creating separate 1 min and daily data for these 150 shares
    @-format 1 min and take the csh150 file and take close from nse site and save data.
    -create script to save weekly data from start to end
    @-FIND A WAY TO AUTOMATE CREATION OF SHEETS FOR THE FIRST TIME AS THAT'S THE MOST TIME CONSUMING PROCESS(pandas???)
    -after data is made, do the checking of previous day to see what actual trades happened or not(use less confusing names)


todo:   running order
nest trader till all shares are properly saved
download fo and cash bhavcopy
cash - algo - fo (concurrent)
30 min cash
cash bhavcopy
data feed(todo don't forget to increment daily offset and weekly offset and weekly, monthly or closing flags)
changing date variables


ACTUAL ALGO TRADING APP(CLI Probably)
    -


30-SEP-2024
    - Keep an excel file that tracks changes made to the data (manual)

    - ADD TCS, TITAN, BAJAJ-AUTO in cash but not daily chart and daily 30 min whatsapp images

    - ADD TS, remove ASHOKLEY and M&MFIN from chart and renumber the cash shares to only reflect ones in daily chart



DONE FOR ALGO:
    - add an 'if' to check if today is holiday and also, non-decimal numbers are coming as XX., remove the .
    - FIX DATA ERROR IN ALGO (Maybe cash too) dated 6-JUN-24 and in that subsequent week, month and closing
    - add h-l & weekly diff in percentages as well and color the trend col (move trend to end) for all shares in cash and
      algo (d/w/m/cl)
    - Fix h-l & weekly diff for days when the previous are a holiday (most likely can be fixed by Excel formula: check
      if 1 or 2 days before are null, then take the prev day)

    SOLN:  GOT formulas in abb for h-l day before problem and using conditional formatting for colors
    TBD- by the end of 30-9-24

    SOLN: check the names of all cash and algo sheets and whether they have the same column format, if not, make it the
          same but check if it breaks the code or not. After that, fix the 6-JUN-24 data error and then write a script to
          re-enter the correct formulas, add 2 columns for % and color the trend column using a formula

          !! bold arial 11 font throughout all F3-j3 till end // bold_font = Font(name='Arial', size=11, bold=True)

          % hl diff = hl diff / ltp * 100 (2 decimal pts)
          % cl diff = cl diff / prev day ltp * 100 (2 decimal pts)


DONE:
    - weekly, monthly, closing close should be LTP

    - stop making 30 min fo (don't remove tab as it will mess us coords but only generate nifty and bn 30 min fo and
      save them with cash instead of copying like we do now)
      SOLN: move NIFTY and BN to 30 min CSH and stop copying from 30 min FO

    - Move nifty and bn fut data to 'fut' sheet in respective cash sheets

    - Remove hourlys for all removed sheets for FO (create them but don't put in pen-drive when transferring)

    - rename algo folder to algo old and now only copy certain shares into algo folder that will go to papa pc
