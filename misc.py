# The biggest secret of the best traders in the world is that they're just like everyone
# they're like, well, how do I know if something fits my personality? Like, how do I find that?
# And so what you need in that situation first and foremost is someone else who knows that you

#   However, they've worked hard to learn the markets and discover what works and what doesn't.
#  How do I know if this approach is a good fit for me? Because the chances are, even if you do find
#   orders across the board, as opposed to having to go through ARCA, INCA, Ireland, and so

#   You can do it by listening to Chat with Traders.
#   And so they exploited this and then built an entire business around it.
#   Here's your host, Aaron Feifield.
#  right away. It's still going to take some time. So, I mean, do you have any tips and pointers for
#   into a simulator and understanding all the different order types and everything else.
#   and without misleading you. And it's very hard to do in the financial, in the trading business,
#  I mean, there was a point where their shop had hundreds of traders in it.
#   So still a technical part of the process that takes about, so we're about three weeks in.
#  Sponsoring this episode is Real Vision TV, the world's only video and demand channel
#   how someone can identify when a strategy or an approach to trading is well suited to them?
#  to continue on this point, do you have any suggestions for how developing traders may be able to monitor
#   I was not in that process.
#   because there's a lot out there that is very misleading. There are a lot of mentors who have
#   I was still that was way before my time, but in 2000, I came across several people who
#   Then that trader spends about a month on SIM and the month on SIM is really dedicated to the
#   for finance.
#   This means at any time you can tune in to watch detailed interviews and presentations
#   their progress? Because the reason I ask that is because like I mentioned just before, usually when
#   never traded professionally. There are a lot of program or indicator or system makers who have
#   Okay. That's a fair question. To answer that, I would have to look at the specific person,
#   from extremely bright people who know money and markets.
#   process of watching the market tick by tick by tick from the time they get in to the time they
#  you come to start trading a new strategy or take a new approach to markets, there is inconsistency
#   were incubated in that process, were trading actually out of it in Arizona and had moved
#   not seen success in that system and therefore are selling it, things like that. I've seen a lot
#   I'm talking the best analysts, fund managers, economists, traders and investors all in one
#  but let's take you, for example. You started out wanting to trade. You deposited, I believe it was
#  leave documenting what they've done and they develop an understanding of how their particular
#  to Florida to book or Tom, Florida.
# in the beginning and often for the first few years. So is there another way to measure your

# place.
# of things which I was completely oblivious to before 2009 when I came online and started to look
# And so they were trading the same process that it was a room of about 25 traders, some
# $5,000 into an account and you wanted to learn how to trade. And that led you to exploring
#  progress besides just P&L? Great question. I am very anti-P&L as a measure of progress.
#  market flows and all traders start out on a thin index like the Dow, something slow enough and so
# around. And that's why my focus is to cut through all that and kind of, I see a great benefit to just
# slash traders and get yourself set up with a free seven day trial of Real Vision TV.
#  of whom were making ridiculous money.
# how do I trade. And I believe that led you to this broadcast, right, which is a very, very
# I mean, the DayTech group in general, there were many, many traders in there making over
# [51:00.980 --> 51:06.840]  on to follow along but I never tell them, no you need to trade a Dow or no you need to trade crude,
# [31:01.840 --> 31:07.760]  successful broadcast. Is that, do I have the history right? Essentially, yeah, yeah. Okay.
# [01:01.340 --> 01:07.500]  Again, that's realvisiontv.com forward slash traders for a free seven day trial to start
# [21:02.540 --> 21:10.960]  saying, here's what it's going to take. It's very ugly. It seems very difficult to overcome at first.
# [51:06.840 --> 51:11.620]  no you're going to do the Euro stocks or the DAX or whatever. It's really a function of
# [11:06.480 --> 11:13.100]  half a million dollars a year doing this brainless manual ARB, just buying in front
# [41:06.360 --> 41:17.520]  And the example of that is if you look at any profession in which there's a pretty sizable
# [01:07.500 --> 01:08.560]  streaming now.
# [31:08.220 --> 31:16.400]  So, Aaron, how would you like to trade wheat using moon cycles? How does that sound to you?
# [01:09.680 --> 01:10.980]  Okay, what's up?
# [01:11.220 --> 01:11.580]  How you doing?
# [01:11.900 --> 01:17.520]  This week for the second time on Chat with Traders, my guest is Morad or better known as
# [21:11.820 --> 21:19.580]  But in the end, it's all contingent on your ability to recognize within yourself what needs to change
# [51:11.620 --> 51:16.300]  looking at different markets and deciding which one suits your personality sort of.
# [11:13.100 --> 11:14.700]  of size, selling in front of size.
# [11:15.620 --> 11:17.780]  And that's what we were doing for a while.
# [31:16.400 --> 31:23.840]  Yeah, no, that's not appealing to me. Okay. That's not your, that doesn't suit your personality.
# [51:16.380 --> 51:24.520]  Which one is not boring you to death really and so once they've done that they've pretty much
# [01:17.520 --> 01:18.700]  future trader 71.
# [11:17.940 --> 11:24.840]  So you would have a screen that had maybe 10 products, 10 boxes, level two boxes on
# [41:17.520 --> 41:26.260]  demand, meaning there's a good payout. Think of a cardiologist or cardio surgeon or brain
# [01:19.760 --> 01:22.220]  As you could imagine, FT is a future trader.
# [21:20.320 --> 21:26.500]  and to make that change. So to answer your question, what does it take? It takes
# [01:22.620 --> 01:26.980]  He's also very short term and has been trading for around about 16 years now.
# [11:24.840 --> 11:32.600]  it, various stocks, and you were just constantly monitoring for size coming in and pushing the
# [51:24.520 --> 51:32.760]  accumulated all the technical skills that they need and have a false confidence in their edge
# [31:24.220 --> 31:32.720]  How would you like to trade corn using the price of sugar? That may be something you'll
# [21:26.500 --> 21:34.500]  a little bit of help and the understanding that much of the time that you will focus
# [41:26.260 --> 41:34.960]  surgeon. There's a high demand for that kind of skill set and so we pay a lot for it. Imagine if
# [01:27.400 --> 01:31.980]  During this time, he was the founder of a successful prop firm and more recently has
# [01:31.980 --> 01:34.360]  started a brokerage stage five trading.
# [31:32.720 --> 31:38.960]  be interested to look into as long as there's a correlation, maybe not. But if you do the study
# [11:32.600 --> 11:38.380]  book, an institution coming in and just putting a massive order of say, 10 million shares to
# [51:32.760 --> 51:39.800]  and I know this and so they start to trade live. It takes the trader a process of burning through
# [41:34.960 --> 41:43.280]  you needed brain surgery and your surgeon happened to have measured all of his progress
# [21:35.140 --> 21:41.780]  will probably be on learning a trading system or an edge that will make money. But really,
# [01:35.080 --> 01:42.100]  First time around on episode 37, we spoke extensively about FT's path of becoming a trader, market
# [11:38.380 --> 11:42.200]  buy, and then they start to move that order up because they needed to fill it.
# [31:38.960 --> 31:45.880]  and find that correlation, you'll suddenly find yourself, it's more of a feeling. You find
# [51:39.800 --> 51:46.140]  out of the $25,000 they'll burn through about 18,000 in general somewhere between 15 and 20,000
# [21:42.700 --> 21:47.240]  what it's going to take for you to make money is not some trading system or an indicator. It is
# [11:42.800 --> 11:46.580]  And you would just be buying in front of them and then selling to them as they upticked.
# [01:42.100 --> 01:45.580]  profile and volume profile and creating a legacy.
# [41:43.280 --> 41:48.580]  throughout med school, his residency, his or her residency and fellowship and everything else,
# [31:45.880 --> 31:54.460]  yourself absorbed by this approach. For me, it was, you know, the NASDAQ is moving up,
# [01:45.580 --> 01:48.180]  This time, we spoke about all new topics.
# [51:46.140 --> 51:53.420]  so it will average about 18,000 in losses as they work out their issues and so on.
# [21:47.240 --> 21:53.580]  your ability to execute on something that has an edge in the market. I don't know if I answered
# [11:47.320 --> 11:52.020]  And when they upticked, they upticked in what was called a teeny, which was one eighth
# [01:48.660 --> 01:53.000]  For example, how to learn a new skill, how to measure your progress besides personnel,
# [41:49.180 --> 41:59.400]  was simply making the decisions on your health care based on dollars they earned. So I am going
# [11:52.020 --> 11:54.440]  of a dollar, which is 12 and a half cents.
# [01:53.660 --> 01:59.540]  how to remove attachment to the outcome, how FT uses a regressive risk management strategy
# [21:53.580 --> 21:57.620]  your question there. Yeah, no, I think that was a really good answer. And I mean, we're going to
# [51:54.000 --> 51:59.960]  So the technical side of things really gets all wrapped up at about five to six weeks
# [11:55.140 --> 12:07.160]  So that made the bid offer spread really large on say, 10,000 shares, and that caused
# [31:55.320 --> 32:02.960]  the S&P is sluggish, the Dow is starting to move up. I'm buying the S&P. I'm ready to sell the NASDAQ
# [21:57.620 --> 22:05.160]  go a little deeper into this as well. So how can we avoid spending time on things that don't matter?
# [41:59.400 --> 42:05.380]  to do this particular procedure even though you may not need it because it gives me the maximum
# [01:59.540 --> 02:01.220]  and plenty more too.
# [52:00.920 --> 52:12.600]  and then they spend the next four to six months getting over the personality psychological problem.
# [02:01.820 --> 02:05.660]  This is a really big episode and FT shares a ton of practical info.
# [32:02.960 --> 32:07.580]  if it doesn't, it doesn't continue when the S&P starts moving down. And I'm going to do that
# [22:05.440 --> 22:11.140]  Like, how can we be aware or conscious of the things we're spending time on that they're actually
# [42:06.260 --> 42:12.620]  profitability. Or I can take care of the same issue by putting you on a course of antibiotics
# [02:06.320 --> 02:11.240]  So if you need to, you know, listen to three times and take notes as you're going.
# [12:07.160 --> 12:12.580]  some guys to, I mean, some of the guys I traded with had, you know, not that this is typical,
# [32:08.300 --> 32:16.780]  five, six hundred times a day trading anywhere between two to three thousand round turns a day.
# [22:11.140 --> 22:18.600]  the right things that we should be spending time on? Like, how do we know where to funnel our focus?
# [02:11.240 --> 02:17.100]  At Shell also just mentioned quickly, there were a few minor glitches in the audio as we
# [12:13.000 --> 12:19.220]  but they would have, you know, a couple hundred thousand dollar days doing this.
# [52:13.080 --> 52:20.940]  The great majority of the cost of backing a trader or turning a trader from an absolute novice who
# [42:13.280 --> 42:17.100]  which will make me a hundred dollars instead of a hundred thousand dollars,
# [02:17.100 --> 02:17.580]  were recording.
# [42:17.600 --> 42:24.260]  but may save you from going through risky surgery. So if we measure everything by P&L,
# [02:17.980 --> 02:18.940]  Please just roll with it.
# [32:17.220 --> 32:22.600]  That's all I did when I started trading futures. And that appealed to me. It was quick. If I was
# [02:19.080 --> 02:21.120]  They only last a few seconds at most.
# [12:19.220 --> 12:26.780]  And so when I joined, I was trading 200 share lots, it took me a while to figure out what
# [22:20.620 --> 22:32.740]  So that's the part where it helps to have a group or to be to have someone who has some 10-year experience
# [52:20.940 --> 52:29.100]  has no idea what a trade is to someone who's clicking every day and consistently seeing a
# [02:21.740 --> 02:22.760]  Anyway, here we go.
# [32:22.600 --> 32:31.120]  wrong, I was immediately out. But over time, it didn't feel right anymore because it seemed
# [02:23.040 --> 02:26.420]  This is my second interview with future trader 71.
# [42:24.620 --> 42:32.020]  we find that the world would be in a much worse place and that is exactly what happens with
# [12:26.780 --> 12:27.520]  was going on.
# [12:27.660 --> 12:30.140]  I had no idea what a bid is or an offer is.
# [02:29.340 --> 02:31.520]  All in all, everything is really good.
# [52:29.100 --> 52:36.420]  positive outcome on most days. 80% of the time is spent on the psychology the psychological
# [02:31.640 --> 02:32.120]  I'm very happy.
# [32:31.120 --> 32:37.140]  like I was taking tremendous risk for very little return. So in my process of exploring other
# [12:31.020 --> 12:34.960]  And by the time I had it figured out, 9-11 had come around.
# [02:32.560 --> 02:33.160]  Oh, awesome.
# [42:32.020 --> 42:37.680]  trading. If you're sitting there, if you're a trader who's listening to this and you spend much
# [02:33.500 --> 02:34.020]  That's good to hear.
# [22:33.560 --> 22:39.960]  in the market. They help narrow that field down for you. I'll give you an example. I have never,
# [02:34.180 --> 02:34.640]  That's good to hear.
# [02:34.760 --> 02:36.860]  We've got a really great response from your last interview.
# [12:35.180 --> 12:39.860]  And also the market went from a teeny to decimals.
# [52:36.420 --> 52:44.320]  personality issues and a huge chunk of that 80% is the attachment problems what I call the
# [42:37.680 --> 42:44.340]  of your day trading while your P&L is flashing on your screen, you are essentially
# [32:37.140 --> 32:43.380]  things, I felt that, you know, FIBs may be the thing to look at. Now, I got excited about
# [02:37.140 --> 02:40.000]  So I'm sure this one will be well received also.
# [02:40.000 --> 02:41.140]  Hope so.
# [12:40.180 --> 12:47.080]  So you went from a 12 and a half cent spread to a penny spread, and you're doing this arb,
# [22:40.800 --> 22:47.900]  I had almost a 92% success rate in my prop shop and I defined success as
# [02:41.640 --> 02:41.940]  Yeah.
# [02:42.560 --> 02:45.740]  So anyway, I've put together a few notes from my side.
# [32:43.940 --> 32:52.420]  studying FIBs and Elliot Waves and Dremen Geometry and Gart Lee's. And I've looked at all these things,
# [52:44.320 --> 52:52.780]  attachment problem. It is the fact that we are unable to let go of what has happened and to look at
# [42:45.420 --> 42:51.100]  putting yourself in a situation where it's very, very, very difficult not to start trading that
# [02:46.000 --> 02:50.500]  I think some of the topics I'd like to talk to you about, which I've mentioned to you
# [12:48.740 --> 12:50.240]  So basically acting as a market maker.
# [12:48.260 --> 12:48.740]  right?
# [12:50.440 --> 12:55.960]  So all of a sudden, a lot of these traders just fell out because there was no edge anymore.
# [02:50.500 --> 02:50.820]  on Twitter.
# [22:50.600 --> 23:00.820]  a trader completing their three-year contract and leaving on a positive with a positive equity,
# [02:51.200 --> 02:56.640]  So pretty much a trader development, risk management, managing drawdowns, tips for
# [42:51.100 --> 42:57.920]  P&L. In other words, your trading decision are not based on market behavior, market structure and the
# [52:52.780 --> 53:00.400]  it for what it is. So the fact that you lost money yesterday because yesterday was a choppy day
# [32:53.040 --> 33:01.380]  but there was always this sense that I don't get it. This makes no sense. Or floor pivots,
# [02:56.640 --> 02:58.100]  linking up with a really good broker.
# [42:57.920 --> 43:05.900]  auction. They start to become something that is based on how you feel about the amount of money
# [12:57.340 --> 13:05.140]  So with high frequency and the penny spread, that ended up drying up.
# [02:59.080 --> 03:02.020]  And I've also opened a Facebook group.
# [53:00.400 --> 53:10.640]  or whatever and it wasn't your type of day you have to look at that in its own box and you have to take
# [23:00.880 --> 23:11.120]  including membership. That's my measure of success. And my job was to kind of corral
# [33:01.380 --> 33:06.960]  floor trader pivots. I'm sure you've heard of those. The mathematical, mathematically based
# [03:02.680 --> 03:08.340]  So anyone listening to this, if you want to join chatwithtraders.com forward slash Facebook,
# [43:05.900 --> 43:12.460]  you've made or how you feel about how much money you've lost. You notice that most traders who are
# [13:05.520 --> 13:08.840]  And it certainly dried up with 9-11 when the market was closed for two months.
# [33:07.540 --> 33:14.720]  numbers that come off of yesterday's open high-low close that are computed and used for today's
# [03:08.340 --> 03:13.580]  completely free to join, of course, I posted in there that I was having you back on the
# [13:09.020 --> 13:16.420]  So I took what was left in my trading account, which I ran up from around $54,000 to a lot
# [53:10.640 --> 53:17.820]  that box and kind of put it away and look at today as its own discrete new session just like you
# [23:11.800 --> 23:17.880]  that energy. Someone comes in and they think, oh my God, if I do this, oh, I noticed that this happens
# [43:12.460 --> 43:19.960]  trading within their plan, they trade very little. There's a lot of space in between trades because
# [03:13.580 --> 03:13.920]  podcast.
# [03:14.320 --> 03:17.960]  And if there were any questions that some of the members would like to ask you.
# [33:14.720 --> 33:22.840]  trading. That mathematically, that sounded okay. But to me, I wanted my personality such that I
# [13:16.680 --> 13:22.280]  And I took that and I bought a home with it.
# [13:16.420 --> 13:16.680]  more.
# [23:17.880 --> 23:23.780]  and this happens and only if I can throw a 500 lot in the bonds to make millions of dollars in
# [03:18.060 --> 03:19.480]  So I've got a few members that have come.
# [53:18.040 --> 53:24.660]  have to look at every trade today from trade to trade to trade as its own discrete outcome
# [03:19.900 --> 03:20.200]  Sorry.
# [43:19.960 --> 43:25.520]  they're waiting, they're being patient enough to wait for the next setup. Traders who are losing
# [03:20.620 --> 03:23.440]  I've got a few questions that have come out of the Facebook group as well.
# [33:22.840 --> 33:31.360]  wanted to understand what makes the market. What is it trying to do when it's moving up? What
# [13:22.420 --> 13:23.740]  I thought trading was done with.
# [23:23.780 --> 23:31.140]  one day. No, we're going to focus on just this today. Today, you're going to focus on getting
# [03:23.660 --> 03:26.340]  So we'll tackle those as we go.
# [13:24.000 --> 13:28.580]  I bought a home in West Palm Beach and was looking for something else to do when I found
# [53:25.240 --> 53:32.440]  and each discrete outcome has an equal chance of either winning or losing 50-50 even though
# [43:25.520 --> 43:34.320]  money generally have their P&L on their screen and generally are trading minutes apart. It's
# [03:26.700 --> 03:29.020]  So I just requested to join that group.
# [13:28.580 --> 13:31.960]  out that there were still some opportunities in the equities side.
# [03:29.660 --> 03:30.020]  Nice.
# [03:30.440 --> 03:30.580]  Nice.
# [03:30.900 --> 03:31.540]  Good to have you in there.
# [33:31.360 --> 33:36.200]  and why does it sometimes move down with no volume and sometimes it moves down with a lot
# [23:31.140 --> 23:37.160]  in long and scratching the trade. That's all you're going to do. You need to build trust in your
# [53:32.440 --> 53:40.200]  you might have a 70% win rate even though you might have a profit factor of 1.5 to 1 or something.
# [03:33.100 --> 03:34.160]  So all right.
# [13:33.340 --> 13:38.240]  And I joined Schoenfeld and Boca Raton and traded with them for a while and then found
# [03:34.220 --> 03:34.980]  Well, let's roll into it.
# [43:34.320 --> 43:42.860]  on good days, they have to wait a half hour, maybe two hours in between trades but on bad days,
# [03:34.980 --> 03:42.140]  But so if anyone hasn't heard our first interview, which was on episode 37, so if you
# [33:36.200 --> 33:45.780]  of volume? And so organizing the information in a way that explained these things that appealed
# [23:37.160 --> 23:42.940]  ability to take yourself out when things aren't working right. You need to build trust in your
# [13:38.240 --> 13:46.660]  out about futures and ended up a friend of mine.
# [53:40.200 --> 53:49.440]  It doesn't matter the very next trade has an outcome that is absolutely unknowable and I think
# [23:42.940 --> 23:49.340]  ability to react to the market without emotion or with as little emotion as possible,
# [03:42.140 --> 03:47.520]  want to check that out, chatwithtraders.com forward slash 37, you guys can go and listen
# [43:42.860 --> 43:46.760]  they're waiting two, three minutes and that's because they're measuring their performance with
# [33:45.780 --> 33:54.940]  to me gave me a home. So I looked for an explanation using market profile, but market profile uses
# [43:46.760 --> 43:53.460]  their P&L. You want to measure your performance, you have to track a little bit more information.
# [13:46.660 --> 13:50.140]  To Chicago to find a spot and a prop shop to trade futures.
# [03:47.520 --> 03:53.900]  to the first time we spoke, for anyone who hasn't heard that yet, or who might be unfamiliar
# [53:49.440 --> 53:54.560]  I talked about this in our first session but it's just it's so hard for people to see that.
# [23:50.940 --> 23:58.320]  as opposed to going out and finding the best curve fitted, optimized, moving average possible
# [13:50.140 --> 13:57.420]  So my stint in the Sohs environment lasted a little over a year.
# [53:54.960 --> 54:04.340]  I'll give you an example imagine if Messi every time he would go to the goal and he would miss
# [33:54.940 --> 34:01.860]  30-minute time slots, doesn't take a volume into account at all. But when I started to switch,
# [43:54.380 --> 44:01.900]  Mainly, you need to track your errors. That's a huge thing. I have shown in the past, of course,
# [03:54.420 --> 03:58.880]  with who you are, FT, could you just give us a real quick sort of rundown on who you
# [23:58.320 --> 24:03.020]  for the product that you're trading. To me, that is not something you can grow from.
# [03:58.880 --> 04:01.720]  are, what you're all about, and then we'll take it from there.
# [13:58.660 --> 14:04.960]  And it wasn't something that I could tell from the very beginning that it was all based on
# [34:01.960 --> 34:09.480]  and this was by accident, my trading software, which was a CQG integrated client,
# [44:01.900 --> 44:07.820]  on this broadcast, we don't have any visuals but I have taken someone's live trades
# [04:02.720 --> 04:10.780]  So the 30-second elevator pitch is, I've been trading professionally for about 16 years
# [24:03.960 --> 24:11.120]  I think you had an interview with Jeff Davis, who's a friend of mine, great guy. And he said a lot
# [54:04.980 --> 54:11.080]  he would take a shot at the goal and he would miss imagine if for the rest of the game
# [14:04.960 --> 14:06.520]  how much money was being made.
# [14:06.760 --> 14:13.660]  There was really no compared to the investing and the personal trading that I was doing before
# [44:08.840 --> 44:15.040]  and someone who is very diligent about recording each trade and whether it fit within the plan
# [34:10.940 --> 34:16.540]  had this option to turn on these volume bars and I turned them on. And in fact, on my
# [04:10.780 --> 04:11.120]  now.
# [24:11.120 --> 24:21.080]  of the exact right things as far as just focus on just push, technically push enough
# [04:11.600 --> 04:22.480]  I started out in equities as a SOS trader, as a SOS bandit, so to speak, and moved to
# [54:11.680 --> 54:21.420]  he is measuring his next shot at the goal based on the last shot okay I went too far to the right
# [14:13.660 --> 14:14.020]  it.
# [14:14.020 --> 14:19.480]  It just, you could tell that it had no sustainable value overall.
# [44:15.040 --> 44:22.800]  or if it's an error trade. Error trades are things like trades that where you took
# [34:16.540 --> 34:24.680]  ladder, on my X-trader, my TTX-trader Pro, the ladder had these bars on the side that showed you
# [14:19.920 --> 14:25.760]  But as I said, there were a lot of porches and Ferraris and so on parked on the outside
# [54:21.420 --> 54:26.760]  now I'm going to shoot to the left and I'm doing it with a heartache and I'm doing it with anger
# [24:22.160 --> 24:33.200]  to find something that suits your personality, that you can then look for an edge in.
# [04:22.480 --> 04:23.160]  futures.
# [44:23.420 --> 44:30.640]  along when you should have taken a short. You have fear of missing out FOMO, you've chased the market
# [04:24.360 --> 04:30.760]  I started out in Florida, in Boca Raton, and moved up to Chicago to trade futures at
# [34:24.680 --> 34:29.460]  how much traded at each one of the prices up and down the ladder. And I started to notice,
# [14:25.760 --> 14:28.320]  and there was the allure of showing up.
# [54:26.760 --> 54:33.540]  and resentment and I'm disappointed myself just imagine if that happened every time he kicked the ball
# [14:28.500 --> 14:34.160]  I mean, my first day showing up, I sat behind someone who was up $18,500 in the first hour.
# [34:29.500 --> 34:37.340]  as the market moved towards prices that had very little volume, it tended to balance the first time
# [44:30.640 --> 44:36.000]  instead of waiting for it to get to your price, taking someone else's trade. In other words,
# [04:30.900 --> 04:37.520]  a prop group in the Board of Trade, and essentially my entire trading career has been
# [54:33.540 --> 54:39.060]  he would be a terrible player just as there are many many terrible players and many many sports
# [24:33.500 --> 24:39.420]  In other words, test it out whether it's by clicking in a simulator and penalizing your exits to make
# [14:34.900 --> 14:35.480]  You can't.
# [14:35.800 --> 14:36.920]  It's hard to resist that.
# [44:36.400 --> 44:41.700]  there was no trade for you but someone said they just got long. That person made money on the last
# [04:37.520 --> 04:40.740]  in a group setting or in a professional environment.
# [14:38.400 --> 14:46.540]  But Sohs was something that was cheap and it was an exploit that just like all exploits
# [34:38.220 --> 34:43.260]  as it pushed to those prices. It would take a small balance before it failed and it would
# [54:39.620 --> 54:45.640]  who are angry at the fact that they missed an easy shot or they should have smashed the ball
# [24:39.420 --> 24:47.520]  up for the unrealistic fills or whatever. But push to the point where you can simply
# [44:41.700 --> 44:46.480]  trade in your chat room or on Twitter or whatever so you just decided to jump in with them. That's
# [04:42.360 --> 04:49.460]  And now I've moved away from being in a professional environment to creating a professional
# [34:43.260 --> 34:47.080]  push through. And then it would pull back to that low volume price before it continued.
# [54:45.640 --> 54:51.600]  they end up hitting it outside of the line in a tennis court or whatever what you have to do
# [14:46.540 --> 14:52.820]  in the financial market, it lasted for a while, a bunch of people benefited from it and that
# [44:46.480 --> 44:54.900]  an error trade, a technical error trade meaning you click the wrong button or something and there are
# [34:47.720 --> 34:55.100]  And so I started to look at what if I looked at things from the perspective of volume per price
# [24:48.380 --> 24:54.420]  feel comfortable doing something, living with it. And then once you've done that,
# [04:49.460 --> 04:50.020]  environment.
# [04:50.260 --> 04:59.660]  I was running a prop shop at the Board of Trade since 2004, from 2004 to about 2010, and then
# [54:51.600 --> 54:56.140]  as a trader is the same thing that you have to do as an athlete and that is to recognize that
# [14:52.820 --> 14:53.800]  edge disappeared.
# [24:54.640 --> 24:58.900]  now you can refine that particular thing. And it could be as simple as
# [14:54.820 --> 14:55.220]  Yeah, yeah.
# [44:54.900 --> 45:02.800]  two others. If you track those errors and you take those errors out of your performance, you would be
# [34:55.640 --> 35:01.920]  over time? So I can see yesterday's volume per price, last weeks, last months, everything since
# [14:55.860 --> 14:57.680]  Now that was really interesting to get your take on that FT.
# [14:55.380 --> 14:55.520]  Okay.
# [54:56.140 --> 55:03.740]  every contact you have with whatever it is the market the ball every contact is discrete
# [14:58.340 --> 15:04.020]  And the Sohs Bandits, I noticed they're actually really heavily profiled in Scott Patterson's
# [24:59.980 --> 25:11.000]  I will trade with fibs or I will take the reversal trade after the market opens and that's my trade
# [04:59.660 --> 05:05.500]  from there I decided to look online and start working on other things.
# [35:01.920 --> 35:10.140]  the last swing low or swing high, and that made a lot of sense to me. And so that became the thing
# [45:03.380 --> 45:11.540]  absolutely astounded as to how much those errors cost. Your goal as a trader is not to look at
# [55:03.740 --> 55:13.060]  its outcome is absolutely judged within itself and that is so hard for people to get now don't
# [15:04.020 --> 15:05.760]  book, Dark Pools.
# [15:05.760 --> 15:09.840]  So if anyone listening is keen to hear more about that, that's a good place to look.
# [05:06.040 --> 05:09.720]  And since then I started a brokerage with a partner.
# [35:10.140 --> 35:15.680]  that I got excited about and I threw everything else away because that made sense to me. It suited
# [15:10.400 --> 15:14.400]  And also, if you want to hear more about FT, sorry about how he came into this business,
# [05:10.440 --> 05:15.440]  The brokerage is called Stage 5 Trading, and my focus within the brokerage is not to sell
# [25:11.000 --> 25:20.960]  of the day. If you can master that one trade or three or four signals, three or four setups,
# [45:11.540 --> 45:17.860]  how much money I make on a daily basis. It's nice, that's why we're here to make money overall.
# [55:13.060 --> 55:18.740]  mistake this with the fact that you need an overall edge that if you string all of these discrete
# [15:14.840 --> 15:19.000]  check out chatwithtraders.com forward slash 37 for our first interview.
# [35:15.680 --> 35:22.700]  my personality. I had this particular curiosity. Whereas we have other traders within Stage 5,
# [05:15.440 --> 05:19.100]  the brokerage or anything, but to focus on trader development.
# [45:17.860 --> 45:25.280]  But you're not just like the doctor or the surgeon or the engineer, your next trading decision is
# [55:18.740 --> 55:30.200]  outcomes together you get a sample of n sample data and the overall outcome the overall outcome
# [15:19.260 --> 15:24.500]  So one of the topics I'd really like to dig into now is traded development.
# [05:19.100 --> 05:26.300]  In other words, my goal is to bring as much as possible the experience I had as a prop
# [25:21.280 --> 25:28.260]  if you can just become the supreme commander of those signals, I have money that's going to stand
# [35:22.700 --> 35:33.100]  for example, who trade tremendous size, who are going basically by a stochastic type of read on
# [15:25.840 --> 15:33.140]  Let's start by talking about what's the process of how to actually learn a new skill.
# [45:25.280 --> 45:34.840]  irrelevant of what your P&L is. In fact, your current trade is absolutely discrete in nature
# [05:26.300 --> 05:32.660]  shop operator, and I was very successful doing that, to the retail public.
# [25:28.260 --> 25:35.000]  behind you and say, okay, let's turn it up. Let's go from trading two lots to trading 10s, 15s,
# [55:30.200 --> 55:35.900]  of that entire sample has to be positive it has to be profitable in other words you can't have a
# [35:33.100 --> 35:41.260]  multiple timeframes. If I talk to them about volume profiling, they would get glassy-eyed and
# [05:33.160 --> 05:35.260]  So I'm pushing back.
# [15:33.140 --> 15:38.520]  I mean, I think this is a big problem that a lot of traders actually have is knowing the
# [45:34.840 --> 45:44.060]  meaning it has no relation to the prior trade. So your P&L is creating this artificial link
# [25:35.060 --> 25:42.420]  20s, 500 if we need to. And that's the way to make money. It's better than this process that I see
# [55:35.900 --> 55:47.420]  system that loses 70% of the time and makes one-to-one profit to risk profit to stop
# [05:36.040 --> 05:44.220]  My goal is to push back against anyone that is in the business of just signing traders
# [15:38.520 --> 15:40.600]  process of how to learn a new skill.
# [15:41.200 --> 15:46.140]  Because when we're in school, we have a structured learning environment, but trading, we're pretty
# [35:41.260 --> 35:48.440]  start to start to yawn. They found what they like or what makes sense to them, what excites them,
# [25:42.420 --> 25:50.780]  traders go through where they try what Aaron's last guest is doing than they try the next guest and
# [45:44.060 --> 45:50.260]  in between all of these trades that are completely unrelated. Whether you made money on the long
# [05:44.220 --> 05:50.760]  on, giving them the maximum leverage and kind of, you know, shooting them off and letting
# [15:46.140 --> 15:48.780]  much on our own with no structured learning environment.
# [55:47.420 --> 55:53.760]  and expect somehow to make money it's not going to it's mathematically impossible but
# [35:48.960 --> 35:56.380]  and they've spent time focusing on those things. Deliberately testing and checking and playing back
# [15:49.160 --> 15:51.840]  What's your take on this?
# [45:50.940 --> 45:57.180]  last time does not mean you'll make money on this long, this time because the short may be in order.
# [05:50.760 --> 05:55.640]  them sink while they work on the next candidate.
# [25:50.780 --> 25:55.020]  then they get on chat with traders later and decide automation is maybe their thing and then they fall
# [15:52.280 --> 15:56.480]  How should we go about learning a new skill, just taking it back to basics?
# [55:54.380 --> 56:03.820]  if you if you know that hey my very next trade has absolutely no connection with my very last
# [05:55.640 --> 06:03.940]  My goal is to help the industry by helping traders stay as traders for as long as possible.
# [25:55.020 --> 26:00.680]  back. Maybe I should test moving average crossover. This guy's using stochastics. So let me look at
# [35:56.380 --> 36:04.700]  bar by bar, what is happening as the day develops over time. And pretty much every trader I know
# [45:58.200 --> 46:08.520]  So it's better to track, first and foremost, is your execution in line with your plan? So you need
# [15:58.320 --> 16:06.980]  That was the biggest puzzle I had to face when I was in a prop shop in future, because
# [26:00.680 --> 26:07.640]  that. And what you end up with is a whole world of people, of traders who have invested a tremendous
# [56:03.820 --> 56:12.840]  trade then I can trade freely I can just look at the market for what it is right now and that's
# [06:04.400 --> 06:09.440]  I'm not always going to be successful, but I believe slowing traders down and helping them
# [36:05.260 --> 36:10.880]  that has gotten anywhere with trading, and I've known some really big ones in Chicago,
# [16:06.980 --> 16:12.260]  that's the first time when I got exposed to having to be responsible for another trader,
# [26:07.640 --> 26:13.940]  amount of time, a commodity that we cannot recover, just bouncing from one thing to the next,
# [46:08.520 --> 46:14.260]  to start tracking your errors and you need to start tracking how each trade has performed
# [06:09.440 --> 06:15.820]  understand risk and so on will help them get closer to achieving their goal of being a
# [36:11.780 --> 36:17.600]  they have generally come from the field of I trade my feel, didn't do very well,
# [56:12.840 --> 56:19.800]  detachment and so detachment should not be mistaken with carelessness like when I say
# [16:12.940 --> 16:18.020]  to train another trader for a portion of their profits once they made the turn.
# [26:14.380 --> 26:21.200]  all of which could work, all of which might fail. But they have spent so much time at the
# [46:14.260 --> 46:21.280]  on its own and the way I like to track a series of trades is not through overall P&L but through
# [06:15.820 --> 06:16.000]  trader.
# [06:16.660 --> 06:19.460]  So a lot of that, there's a lot of misinformation in our businesses.
# [36:17.980 --> 36:25.080]  then decided forget the feel. I'm going to go back and just go bar by bar by bar and study what the
# [16:18.960 --> 16:24.460]  And it was a big part of my preparation for my own prop shop.
# [06:19.900 --> 06:21.360]  I'm sure you've done so many interviews.
# [56:20.520 --> 56:29.220]  hey you know Aaron you need to be detached from outcome the outcome of what's happening it doesn't
# [06:21.360 --> 06:24.580]  I'm sure you've come across people who've said that before.
# [26:21.200 --> 26:26.120]  beginning of the learning curve over and over and over that they have not been able to master that
# [46:21.280 --> 46:31.880]  expectancy. So we're looking at essentially what the average gain or loss is over a large sample
# [16:24.460 --> 16:27.820]  How do we learn most effectively?
# [06:25.200 --> 06:33.600]  There's a lot of misinformation, a lot of undue strain on traders trying to make it, and there's
# [36:25.080 --> 36:31.320]  market is doing, whether it's pattern, trading, candlestick, using some sort of an indicator,
# [26:26.120 --> 26:31.840]  one thing. So to answer your question, if you find yourself constantly changing and changing and
# [16:28.780 --> 16:31.340]  I did a lot of sports growing up.
# [56:29.220 --> 56:34.600]  mean that you know what forget about risk I don't care I don't care what happens that's not
# [46:31.880 --> 46:36.660]  and the minimum sample size for anyone to consider whether or not they have an edge is probably about
# [26:31.840 --> 26:37.120]  changing the approach that you're taking to the market, then you know something is wrong. You,
# [16:32.280 --> 16:40.320]  I played a lot of soccer, you guys call it football, and basketball.
# [36:32.280 --> 36:38.620]  and so on. Each one of those people got to the point where they suffered enough with the poor
# [06:33.600 --> 06:39.080]  this veil of secrecy that I don't think should exist because it didn't exist in my prop shop
# [56:34.600 --> 56:41.560]  detachment that's just carelessness that's foolishness detachment just simply means I am not defined
# [46:36.660 --> 46:45.700]  50 trades, the absolute minimum. And so you're stringing together this expectancy and we're looking for
# [26:38.260 --> 26:43.940]  for me, it was scalping, you know, order flow. And when that didn't work anymore, I started to
# [36:38.620 --> 36:46.760]  outcome of their effort to go back and say, let me dig down and find just what I need. Just
# [06:39.080 --> 06:39.960]  and we were successful.
# [16:41.280 --> 16:46.900]  And it's pretty much when you're looking at trading, and by the way, when I was hiring,
# [56:41.560 --> 56:50.720]  by this trade I am not defined by a series of today's trades or this week's worth of trades or
# [06:41.060 --> 06:47.540]  We're not automated traders or anything like that, so we're not giving away any secret sauce.
# [26:43.940 --> 26:50.240]  look at pretty much everything, just like everybody else. But then I started to look at volume profiling.
# [16:46.900 --> 16:54.220]  I always favored those who were in a sport on a competitive level.
# [46:46.340 --> 46:52.980]  expectancy in terms of ticks or points instead of dollars. Let's keep dollars out of this. Let's
# [36:46.760 --> 36:52.940]  basically bare bones cut back to exactly the minimum amount of information I need to make a
# [06:47.540 --> 06:56.580]  So I feel like the best thing a trader can have is a structured, dedicated community that
# [26:50.240 --> 26:55.160]  I went from market profiling to volume profiling. And I started to notice,
# [56:50.720 --> 56:56.520]  this month's worth of trades that is not who I am I'm not a good trader just because I had a good
# [46:52.980 --> 46:58.800]  keep dollars to bookkeeping on the weekends but during the trading week you want to track
# [36:52.940 --> 37:00.380]  decision. And it boils down to what is the statistical probability of something continuing
# [16:54.900 --> 17:00.900]  Actually, I'll always favor anyone that was doing something on a competitive level, even
# [56:56.520 --> 57:04.140]  month I'm not a bad trader because I had a poor month I am just trading my plan and my plan says
# [06:56.580 --> 07:01.320]  they can trust and interact with, and that'll help them move along as opposed to being with
# [26:56.300 --> 27:01.940]  with detailed notes, I started to notice that there are certain things that happen consistently
# [47:00.040 --> 47:06.080]  here's my plan, here's how I executed on my plan. I executed every trade on my plan,
# [17:00.900 --> 17:04.840]  if it's chess or music or whatever.
# [37:00.380 --> 37:11.420]  after a specific event. We have a large bar, an expansion of range, on an expansion of volume,
# [07:01.320 --> 07:05.780]  a one-on-one mentor who may or may not know what they're doing.
# [27:02.800 --> 27:09.880]  just enough for me to be able to exploit them with size. And if I can exploit them with size and
# [57:04.140 --> 57:11.280]  that if I follow if I follow the process and follow my risk rules the overall
# [17:04.840 --> 17:17.300]  These all require the same level of focused, deliberate, repetitive consistency.
# [07:06.240 --> 07:12.600]  So that's where I am now, and I'm moving now that the brokerage is set up and it's running.
# [47:06.080 --> 47:12.400]  I executed one out of five trades, I executed five out of five trades, who knows? But you want to
# [27:09.880 --> 27:16.860]  keep my targets modest, my stops modest, I am able to create a positive outcome overall,
# [57:12.040 --> 57:20.900]  and the overarching outcome is going to be positive and so if you start to decide that's what happens
# [47:13.200 --> 47:20.520]  focus on how are you interacting relative to what you plan to do? That's so much more important
# [07:13.480 --> 07:22.520]  I'm moving towards creating a substantial course that takes someone who's coming into
# [37:13.280 --> 37:21.740]  then every time that's happened, or most predominantly, when that happens, we generally
# [27:17.740 --> 27:22.600]  positive expectancy. And all that's left is for me to be confident enough in my numbers
# [17:18.760 --> 17:21.500]  And this is the biggest challenge that I see with traders.
# [47:20.520 --> 47:29.040]  because your exercise, your your attention to become a professional is on the moment to moment
# [57:20.900 --> 57:28.300]  to people who get emotional or who fight the market they are in a deep process of attachment
# [37:21.740 --> 37:31.060]  get a continuation, another expanded bar on higher volume, but not as high as the first time it happened.
# [07:22.520 --> 07:28.280]  futures or trading in general and carries them through the process of understanding all the
# [17:22.440 --> 17:30.600]  Traders like to come in, and they want to take every ounce of knowledge they can get,
# [27:23.180 --> 27:29.960]  to put on a good amount of size. And that's where the money is made. The money is not in buying the
# [57:28.300 --> 57:36.540]  and let me tell you something this is much easier said than done it requires an awful lot of maturity
# [07:28.280 --> 07:33.820]  important pieces to actually come out as a professional trader on the other side.
# [27:29.960 --> 27:35.700]  low, selling the high, selling the high short, and buying the low back. I don't, I think that's
# [47:29.040 --> 47:37.780]  execution, not the fact that you rode a 10-point run in the S&P on a 12-point range day and you're
# [17:30.600 --> 17:35.720]  and then they try this and dabble in that and try that and dabble in this.
# [37:31.540 --> 37:37.800]  And those are what I call impulsive and continuation trades. I can hardly catch the impulsive trade
# [07:33.820 --> 07:43.100]  So my goal is to now take those who want to pursue this and provide a standardized process
# [27:35.700 --> 27:46.740]  that's a fantasy. The money is in grabbing small definable chunks of the rotations that happen
# [17:36.020 --> 17:49.560]  And there's really no measured consistent repeating process which is required for the skill
# [47:37.780 --> 47:44.080]  a superstar. To those people I say watch out, watch your risk, you're about to get whacked by the
# [57:37.340 --> 57:43.180]  and introspection and most importantly it requires a tremendous amount of self-awareness
# [37:37.800 --> 37:42.300]  because it happens without warning. That's big money coming in and out of the market,
# [37:42.740 --> 37:48.100]  but I can certainly try to do something with the continuation trade. And a continuation trade has
# [07:43.680 --> 07:49.380]  for coming out the other end, almost like someone who has an engineering degree or something.
# [57:43.900 --> 57:51.500]  to understand that oh look I'm starting to get hot here I'm starting to get irritated it's time
# [47:44.080 --> 47:51.220]  market because that sort of thing gives people false confidence. But if you can come to me and say
# [27:46.740 --> 27:52.740]  throughout the day in the timeframe that, that is suited to you, that you feel comfortable in.
# [37:48.100 --> 37:56.320]  a 78% probability of if it's an impulsive move up, then a continuation trade generally has a 78%
# [07:49.940 --> 07:54.460]  There's a minimum amount of knowledge that they should have, and that's the next big project
# [17:49.560 --> 17:55.340]  to eventually show that trader what works, what doesn't, what their weaknesses are,
# [57:51.500 --> 57:57.740]  for me to take my hand off the mouse and go for a walk go make lunch go refill my cup of coffee
# [47:51.220 --> 47:58.220]  even if you're trading for me and you came to me and said look I lost $5,000 this month.
# [27:52.980 --> 27:58.380]  Some people feel comfortable in a 15 minute timeframe. Some just want to be in and out in the
# [07:54.460 --> 07:55.240]  I'm working on.
# [17:55.440 --> 17:56.400]  and what their strengths are.
# [37:56.320 --> 38:01.500]  probability of testing after pulling back, of testing that first high. So imagine the market
# [07:56.060 --> 08:01.420]  So there's a lot going on, just the short story is there's probably too much going on for
# [57:57.740 --> 58:05.680]  or whatever let's break this cycle and that's you know that's the old Q routine reward that's
# [17:57.060 --> 17:59.480]  And that's really important, it's an important part of the process,
# [27:58.380 --> 28:04.380]  matter of a few minutes. Just whatever is comfortable for you, the market's there to offer you the
# [17:59.480 --> 18:05.920]  because you want to play to your strengths, like my strength is reading order flow.
# [47:59.100 --> 48:04.920]  But here's my log and I see that you have essentially followed your plan
# [38:01.500 --> 38:08.580]  moving up all of a sudden with great strength, and then it pulls back, creates this flag. And 78%
# [08:01.520 --> 08:03.080]  on health, but I enjoy it all.
# [08:04.040 --> 08:05.820]  Always good to keep busy though, that's right.
# [28:04.380 --> 28:10.140]  opportunity to make money or lose money, depending on, you know, whether that timeframe is in favor
# [58:05.680 --> 58:12.980]  covered in the power of habit one of my favorite books by Doohig you have to break that cycle and the
# [48:06.000 --> 48:10.980]  for the most part and you have very few errors I would say great job keep going
# [08:06.220 --> 08:11.620]  So one of the things I didn't pick up on last time when I had you on the podcast, which I
# [18:08.020 --> 18:15.660]  But I cannot trade just around order flow, so I create a hypothesis on the day, several of them,
# [38:08.580 --> 38:17.360]  of the time in the S&P minis, it will retest that last high, the original push. That's something I
# [28:10.140 --> 28:18.080]  or not. I know that's a lengthy answer, but it's, I'm combining a lot of different experiences that
# [48:11.680 --> 48:18.280]  because it just means that you're executing your plan but your plan does not have an
# [08:11.620 --> 08:16.420]  wanted to ask you about this time around, is the story of the Soze Bandits.
# [58:12.980 --> 58:18.720]  only way to break that cycle is to bring light to it in the form of awareness so if you find that
# [18:16.380 --> 18:20.540]  but I really focus on order flow to the point that if my hypothesis is wrong,
# [08:16.620 --> 08:20.080]  I mean, they were quite well-known when they were around.
# [38:17.360 --> 38:24.940]  can really get into. So it's really a function of trying a bunch of things and then focusing on
# [58:18.720 --> 58:25.200]  you took a great trade you know you wanted to get long in the EES today before this rally up
# [48:18.280 --> 48:24.280]  edge for that particular period of time and every edge disappears and reappears and disappears
# [28:18.080 --> 28:27.320]  I've had, especially with our current clients in our brokerage. And my focus is always to not say,
# [08:20.280 --> 08:23.400]  Can you give us a little bit of background and a little bit of context around who were
# [18:21.140 --> 18:25.140]  the damage is not that great, not can always improve my position in the market.
# [08:23.400 --> 08:25.260]  the Soze Bandits and what did they do?
# [48:24.280 --> 48:30.040]  and reappears. There are times when the market's in balance, there are times when the market's
# [38:24.940 --> 38:32.440]  shedding everything else. Whereas most traders spend a lot of time just accumulating and accumulating
# [18:25.700 --> 18:33.920]  But to answer your question, what traders need to know is that this is not going to be easy.
# [08:26.920 --> 08:30.960]  So the Soze Bandits started way before my time.
# [58:26.000 --> 58:32.320]  you took a long and you just put your stop and that stop happened to be the low of the day
# [08:26.520 --> 08:26.920]  Sure.
# [28:27.740 --> 28:40.000]  hey, look at this additional thing, look at this additional thing. My focus is constantly to, no,
# [48:30.040 --> 48:35.480]  trending and you may be someone who has a plan that has more emphasis on balance than trend.
# [38:32.440 --> 38:36.960]  and accumulating and never really shedding. They're looking at so much on their charts,
# [08:32.040 --> 08:42.880]  They started around 1990, and it was generally, there was a group headed by someone named
# [58:33.200 --> 58:40.160]  and the market hit your stop and then it turned around and it ran up 16 points like it did today
# [18:34.580 --> 18:40.460]  And I know that it sells more books and courses and tools and indicators to say,
# [48:36.080 --> 48:41.660]  So you will lose, it's kind of like an automated trading system. Everybody has an edge for a period
# [38:36.960 --> 38:45.140]  it's impossible to make a decision without second-guessing it. So that's where the words
# [18:40.820 --> 18:44.760]  all you have to do is install this, or all you have to do is read this amazing book,
# [28:40.000 --> 28:47.200]  become incredibly good at these five setups, whatever they are. And that's where your deliberate
# [58:41.320 --> 58:51.320]  you you can't attach all this they're watching me I am cursed and nobody can do this it's a lie
# [48:41.660 --> 48:46.280]  and everybody has a drawdown for a period, it's just the nature of the business. Does that make
# [08:42.880 --> 08:46.040]  Sheldon with DayTech Securities.
# [18:45.900 --> 18:48.000]  and you'll have it figured out.
# [38:45.700 --> 38:48.580]  find something that you're comfortable with. Basically, essentially means
# [48:46.280 --> 48:50.120]  sense? Absolutely, no that was an awesome answer, I really liked how you explained that.
# [28:47.200 --> 28:53.000]  focused practice should lie. That's what, where all of your journaling, tracking, and statistics
# [08:47.060 --> 08:54.480]  What this group did was, for the first time, they managed to get level two access, meaning
# [18:48.560 --> 18:57.080]  But the process usually requires longer than you think is more expensive than you think,
# [38:49.440 --> 38:55.420]  sure go out there and explore, but eventually narrow it down to something that you really like
# [48:50.120 --> 48:55.480]  And this next question might sort of prompt for a similar kind of answer but
# [58:51.320 --> 58:56.880]  that people can trade and make money this is all rigged this is all for the big guys none of that
# [28:53.000 --> 29:01.600]  should be built off of these three, four things that you're exploiting on a daily basis.
# [08:54.480 --> 09:03.620]  they can see the full depth of the market on the various NASDAQ stocks, and they could
# [38:55.420 --> 39:03.120]  and make it as simple as you can. All right, team, here's just a quick word for our sponsor of this
# [48:56.200 --> 49:01.900]  I'm going to ask it anyway and you can give me your take on it. Traders are often attached
# [58:56.880 --> 59:02.740]  is relevant none of that is relevant you have to understand that there is a statistical probability
# [18:57.680 --> 19:01.500]  and requires a lot more dedication than you think.
# [49:01.900 --> 49:06.960]  to the outcome. Now that's quite a problem. What would you say about this?
# [29:02.440 --> 29:08.460]  And that's, that's the way to know if you're completely lost. How do you, how do you narrow
# [19:02.020 --> 19:07.840]  And you will learn a lot more about yourself when you go to trade than you think you will.
# [39:03.120 --> 39:09.620]  episode, Real Vision TV, a truly badass video on demand channel for finance. For some background,
# [59:03.320 --> 59:09.720]  that your stop is going to be the high of day or low of day and it's just so happened that time
# [09:03.620 --> 09:08.500]  see what the institutions are bidding and offering on any given stock.
# [19:08.240 --> 19:15.020]  And in the end, the thing I always told my traders when I was interviewing them is I can't guarantee
# [29:08.460 --> 29:17.000]  down the field? You narrow it down by knowing that I cannot, I cannot be like a weather vein,
# [09:09.080 --> 09:14.240]  So depending on which stock is in play, most common stocks were in play at the time, were
# [39:09.620 --> 39:16.220]  Real Vision TV was founded by global macro trader Ruwau Powell, who you'll remember from episode 79,
# [49:09.640 --> 49:18.100]  So yeah, huge, huge, huge issue and I know there are some psychologists out there who
# [59:09.720 --> 59:15.740]  that was your time you know and if you look at it from a journaling perspective you'll find
# [09:14.840 --> 09:18.760]  Microsoft and JDSU and tech companies like that.
# [19:15.020 --> 19:21.120]  your success, but I can guarantee that no matter what, when you walk away,
# [59:15.740 --> 59:20.440]  that that occurrence the fact that you caught the entire range of the day or the fact that you
# [39:16.720 --> 39:23.760]  he was phenomenal. And 30 are finance fair, Grant Williams. The two started Real Vision TV because
# [29:17.260 --> 29:24.340]  just switching directions depending on the prevailing wind for that day. If you're doing that, then
# [49:18.100 --> 49:23.280]  who probably focus all their attention, trader psychology, so focus their attention on this.
# [09:19.480 --> 09:24.260]  And what they did was they found a way to use what's called the Soze System.
# [59:20.660 --> 59:25.400]  got stopped at the high or the low of the day the occurrence is a lot less significant
# [19:21.320 --> 19:25.880]  when you come up the other end, whether you didn't make it and had to be cut from the prop shop or
# [39:23.760 --> 39:29.580]  mainstream financial media is, you know, let's just be honest here, it's pretty lame. It's sound
# [29:24.340 --> 29:29.160]  your chances are you're losing something that's very, very important. It's not the money in your
# [49:24.040 --> 49:34.200]  So attachment, and I've tried not to get spiritual on you, attachment is a key source of suffering
# [09:24.620 --> 09:34.260]  The Soze stands for Small Order Entry System, and it was designed to fill small lot orders
# [19:25.880 --> 19:34.300]  made it and asked your agreement and are independent, you will know yourself a lot better, you know?
# [59:26.100 --> 59:31.540]  than your mind thinks it is and the mind thinks that it happens a lot more often than you're
# [29:29.160 --> 29:35.700]  account. It's the time that slips by and reduces your chances of being able to make the turn
# [39:29.580 --> 39:35.860]  bites, it's surface level thinking, it's sensationalism. So if you take all of that and flip it on its
# [59:31.540 --> 59:37.720]  you're the unlucky guy because you have this strong attachment to wanting every trade to be
# [49:34.200 --> 49:41.640]  and I'm not a Buddhist or anything like that but it is true. In trading,
# [19:34.780 --> 19:43.620]  But the process has to be, has to focus on the stages of competence, okay?
# [29:35.700 --> 29:39.100]  and make a living at this in a reasonable amount of time.
# [09:35.240 --> 09:43.940]  as opposed to going to a normal, a clear market maker like Ireland, or what we call an
# [39:35.860 --> 39:41.180]  head, then this is what you get, Real Vision TV, which is high value content with depth
# [59:37.720 --> 59:43.440]  a winner and that's what most people do we did a trader intervention um as a as it's a normal
# [29:39.680 --> 29:44.620]  I really like your emphasis on the time there, FT. I think that's a really important point to make.
# [39:41.700 --> 39:47.380]  and no bias or agenda. Once you turn in, there is literally hours upon hours of presentations
# [59:43.440 --> 59:48.900]  feature of being at stage five I did a trader intervention on again a guy named Michael
# [09:43.940 --> 09:52.600]  ECN to fill normal size lots, except we were trading anywhere between 10 and 40,000 shares
# [19:43.620 --> 19:50.360]  And it's understood that everybody comes in and they think they know what they need to know,
# [49:44.160 --> 49:52.500]  let's take the typical new recruit to a prop shop, to my prop shop. So I put up $25,000 in
# [29:45.880 --> 29:50.740]  One of the other things you said and your response there was, you know, finding an approach that
# [39:47.380 --> 39:53.900]  and interviews with billion-dollar fund managers, investors, traders, economists, and analysts
# [59:48.900 --> 59:57.800]  today on his live results and you know you you I really wanted to impress upon him the fact that
# [29:50.740 --> 29:55.300]  fits your personality. And this is something we hear quite often, especially on the podcast.
# [19:50.580 --> 19:55.360]  or they think they can acquire it by reading books or looking at blogs and so on,
# [09:52.600 --> 09:53.420]  per order.
# [49:52.500 --> 49:59.880]  futures for the next trader into a sub account. I go out through this and do this extensive process
# [39:53.900 --> 40:00.160]  who cover all asset classes, even real estate and Bitcoin, plus there's new videos being added
# [09:53.760 --> 09:56.400]  So it was an exploit of the system.
# [19:55.620 --> 19:58.380]  but what they don't know is what they don't know.
# [59:57.800 --> 01:00:03.420]  how he remembers things because he's not the issue he's having really is he's not keeping good
# [09:57.460 --> 10:04.120]  And what happened with the DayTech group is they figured out this way of getting quicker
# [19:58.700 --> 20:02.300]  Like they have no idea what lies beyond their field of view.
# [29:58.120 --> 30:03.680]  From speaking with a number of listeners, I know this is actually something they struggle with,
# [49:59.880 --> 50:08.640]  of selecting a new trader. A lot goes into that and then that trader comes in and starts to go
# [01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:11.780]  track of what's happening he has this confirmation bias in his mind he's he's remembering things
# [01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:18.400]  not really as they are and we all do this we we spend a lot of time avoiding the loss
# [01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:25.680]  I cannot as a professional trader spend all of my time figuring out how I can avoid a loss
# [01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:32.600]  for me I look for a measured loss that is balanced with a profit target for every trade
# [01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:38.980]  and my job is to take every trade if I can manage it a little bit better because I have an
# [01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:45.500]  insight maybe you know the market's not moving in the direction I'm looking for very easily it's
# [01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:50.240]  moving in the opposite direction very easily or sizes coming in and pushing the market in the
# [01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:57.420]  opposite direction I might use that as a cue to reduce my unit size I might go from a 48 lot to
# [01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:03.620]  a 12 lot or a six lot but I still have to take the trade because I know that I cannot
# [01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:11.040]  attach myself to the fact that my last trade was a loss and so on okay does that make sense
# [01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:17.980]  it's really an important topic and it's really hard to it's really hard to get beyond it but
# [01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:24.440]  it's a big part of those people who are struggling to make this happen it's a big part of the issue
# [01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:34.480]  is is just understanding that what happens right now is really not connected to what happened
# [01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:43.440]  last time and cannot be connected to what happens in the future because the the past is is unchangeable
# [01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:50.600]  the future is fabricated all I can do is focus on what's the trade right now and and saying it is
# [01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:56.760]  easy I know but it's your job is to sit there and really focus your attention on the idea that
# [01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:03.000]  I have to follow each trade as if it's the first trade of the day follow each trade
# [01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.920]  as if it's the first trade of the day all day every day wow what a brilliant answer that was
# [01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.700]  that was really good on pleased I asked that and thank you for going into so much detail
# [01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:18.180]  with that answer I think that's going to help a lot of people listening to this podcast right now
# [01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:23.740]  I hope so one of the other things I wanted to ask you while we're on this subject is
# [01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:32.280]  do you have any any tips and pointers for how to properly manage periods of drawdown or periods
# [01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.200]  of losing trades where you're sort of on a run of losers and you just really feel like nothing can
# [01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.160]  go right I know you kind of head on it there with you know not getting attached to the outcome but
# [01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:47.520]  how should a trader properly manage a drawdown and and maybe if you could touch on the risk management
# [01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:56.700]  aspect of that as well okay that's a really big part of staying in the game so I could tell you
# [01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:03.280]  in my career I've I've gone through rough patches every single year that I've been a trader
# [01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:11.800]  if anybody has ever told you that they come in and they make huge money every day of the year
# [01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:19.620]  every year then you'll want to check that trainers credentials the fact is most of the money is
# [01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:26.380]  made in a short period of time a short segment of the year the rest of the year is simply staying
# [01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:33.300]  a foot with the market so that when that opportunity comes to push for example the China
# [01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:39.980]  correction in August you know the big drop you had to you had to have been in the market and
# [01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:45.000]  consistently in the market and following the same routine all the time to be able to participate in
# [01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:53.960]  that in any meaningful way and part of the process of having you know a few short weeks of really
# [01:03:53.960 --> 01:04:02.260]  really good good trades good returns a lot of weeks of just grinding along kind of making a living
# [01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:08.400]  just like everybody else but then there's also that rough patch we call it the rough patch and I've
# [01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:16.080]  had rough patches that have lasted anywhere from two weeks to 10 weeks and they come and go with
# [01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:24.300]  time and most of the time they simply force me to go back to you know go back to stage three of
# [01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:31.760]  competence where we what we would call conscious competence in other words consciously deliberately
# [01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:39.320]  focusedly following some sort of a plan or our original plan or a modified plan to suit
# [01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:46.160]  the current market conditions and so the way to manage rough patches is to have an understanding
# [01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:54.920]  of when one has occurred and the way you know one has occurred is to is to look at the streaks
# [01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:00.540]  that you have and this is again the conversation is always going to go back to really good record
# [01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:06.640]  keeping I mean you're running a business just imagine you're running a bakery or an auto dealership
# [01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.560]  or something it would be crazy to think that you're selling something or you're running a business
# [01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:18.580]  without some really accurate bookkeeping trading is a business and bookkeeping is a huge part of
# [01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:24.880]  this business and so you can always go back and understand that okay I recognize a losing streak
# [01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:34.820]  as for me a losing streak is four consecutive down days in a row and I'm I'm speaking about
# [01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:41.220]  consecutive down days where I'm actually doing what I'm supposed to do as opposed to going off the
# [01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:46.680]  handle and starting to fight the market or something those don't count as consecutive down days it
# [01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:52.320]  just counts as me being emotional and stupid which means I need time off and that's what I force
# [01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:59.580]  myself to do is just to detach just move away but if I have four down days and I'm following my plan
# [01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:07.260]  that it tells me that something has dramatically changed and so my response to that is to and I'll
# [01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:12.960]  go into how I'm managing risk through this process my response to that is to simply take the following
# [01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:24.380]  day off the probability of being down four days in a row is what 0.5 which is a 50 probability of
# [01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:31.080]  losing to the power of four so there's a six and a quarter percent chance that I would have
# [01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:40.600]  four losing days in a row so it's like flipping heads four times in a row so it's 0.5 to the power
# [01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:47.880]  four or six point two five percent I know that for me to hit that kind of probability that's almost
# [01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:56.280]  two sigma or the second standard deviation I wait I'll back off the statistics a little bit but
# [01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:03.700]  for me to hit that it's pretty hard for me to hit three down days in a row and that's down days
# [01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:12.220]  I'm down on my P&L plus my cost plus my daily fixed cost rent software all that stuff broken down
# [01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:20.340]  on a daily basis the fifth day I'm off I'm I'm not trading the fifth day the fifth day is me
# [01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:25.800]  watching the market doing the homework and everything watching the market and I'm spending the day
# [01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:31.460]  just going through trades from the past just running through what has happened pulling up
# [01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:36.860]  higher time frame charts and really trying to see the goal is to see has something changed
# [01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:41.960]  dramatically enough in the market to tell me that something's wrong in fact last week
# [01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:49.480]  was one of these weeks where the market was dramatically unusual we had several days where the
# [01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:56.600]  market gapped up in a row gapped up and never closed the gap and it just continued in the same
# [01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:02.600]  direction that's unusual behavior I didn't I didn't have a drawdown during that
# [01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:07.700]  behavior during that streak but it tells me that something hey be careful something has changed
# [01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:19.300]  how do I manage the losses or the risk intraday I use a regressive risk strategy and so let's say
# [01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:28.920]  just for relevance sake let's say that I generally trade 10 lots in the yes okay and
# [01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:34.880]  if I start out the day and I'm trading 10 lots and I take a trade and I take a loss
# [01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:48.040]  and my loss my daily loss limit let's say is two thousand dollars or three thousand let's call it
# [01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:56.340]  three thousand dollars per day for me to stay in business in the long term if I reach a third
# [01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:04.760]  of the way down then I am cutting my size to six contracts if I get halfway to three thousand
# [01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:11.820]  dollars down then I'm only trading five if I get three quarters of the way down that I'm trading
# [01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:20.740]  poo and I continue to trade two contracts until I hit that limit and that's very rare that I hit
# [01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:28.020]  that loss limit the daily loss limit but I want to hit my daily loss limit with the minimum size
# [01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:35.220]  possible now that's not possible if you're trading one contract you know in the futures or a small
# [01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:44.060]  share size in equities but my goal is not to make back the fifteen hundred dollars that I've
# [01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:49.460]  lost this morning or the twenty five hundred dollars or whatever that's not my goal my focus
# [01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:56.300]  is not the P&L it really isn't took took me a long time to actually be able to accomplish that
# [01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:03.840]  but my goal is to find my alignment with the market I'm going to repeat that my goal is not to make
# [01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:09.780]  the money back my goal is to find my alignment with the market in other words get in the zone
# [01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:18.140]  and get in gear with the market to find that wave to be able to recognize that wave that's coming
# [01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:24.740]  and to be able to paddle my surfboard on top of it and to to finally stand and ride that wave
# [01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:31.120]  back to shore that's my goal and I'm not going to be able to do that by insisting on trading
# [01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.480]  ten lots and ten lots and ten lots and taking losses and then boom five losses five trades
# [01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:42.700]  on a ten lot and I'm out three thousand dollars and I have to stop for the day that's not going to
# [01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:47.940]  help me what I want to do is hit that three thousand three thousand dollar loss limit
# [01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:54.400]  with my smallest size possible because if I can't I can't accomplish that with two contracts
# [01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:01.400]  to where I can find my alignment and start building my account back up with a series of really good
# [01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:09.060]  positive trades then I'm not putting in I'm not giving myself enough sample size or enough
# [01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:16.780]  samples of trades to be able to find that alignment so imagine the opposite imagine if you have you
# [01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:22.420]  traded ten lots and you have a three thousand dollar limit for the day before you have to stop for the
# [01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:29.960]  day imagine if I go halfway through and I lose fifteen hundred dollars and then all of a sudden
# [01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:38.020]  I put on a twenty lot trade and that twenty lot trade wipes away the rest of the fifteen hundred
# [01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:46.280]  dollars okay so out of the three thousand dollars I have gotten I was able to participate in the market
# [01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:55.120]  twice with two trades two trades is not nearly enough to show me that my something's wrong or
# [01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:01.200]  my plan doesn't have an edge my goal is to maximize it if I'm gonna if I'm gonna give away three
# [01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.980]  thousand dollars I need to do it with a large as large number of trades as possible because
# [01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:13.800]  what happens is eventually if I start to find what the market is looking to do I start to find
# [01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:20.300]  alignment and as I cross if I get down from zero to fifteen hundred to twenty five hundred
# [01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:24.540]  to twenty eight hundred dollars and all of a sudden I find myself from twenty eight hundred
# [01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:30.000]  dollars down on two contracts I start to come up to two thousand dollars okay I'm back to four
# [01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.980]  contracts I get to down fifteen hundred dollars I'm up to six contracts or five contracts now I have
# [01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:42.820]  alignment and now I can start building that position back up I have the confidence to push
# [01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:49.280]  those trades or to take the trades that are paying off I've found the edge again and I'm building
# [01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:56.720]  back up and to me every other way I've tried for myself my traders has not worked I've had traders
# [01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:02.760]  use a constant you know doesn't matter how far you're down just keep trading the same size
# [01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:10.020]  and most of the time they just they just limit out for the day and you know the accounts locked
# [01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:18.080]  and are done for the day what I do is I I regress I look for a regression in the amount of I'm trading
# [01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:26.180]  and my goal is to create as many opportunities to read the market to trade the market and read
# [01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:33.220]  the market as possible and I know that most people don't do that but that if I hit three days in a row
# [01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:42.720]  on limit using that method something is dramatically going wrong it really is and if you're trading one
# [01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:49.360]  or two lots just start out with your two lots halfway to your limit let's say your limits you know six
# [01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.820]  hundred dollars you've lost three hundred dollars on your two lots switch to one lots and get really
# [01:13:54.820 --> 01:14:02.360]  picky about your trades just find the trades that you are most confident in that you have the highest
# [01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:08.560]  probabilities on and stake your one lot on that and it should give you about four trades before you lose
# [01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.740]  the entire amount what you don't want to do is take your two-lot trade lose six hundred dollars on
# [01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:23.760]  one trade for the day and that is it that is a very binary way to lose money and my intent always
# [01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:30.340]  in trading is to get the most to make the market work as hard as possible to take my money away
# [01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:37.800]  if it will take my money away and it often does but I want to do it on as many trades as possible I
# [01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:44.840]  want to do it fighting not the market but I want to do it fighting the probabilities fighting the
# [01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:50.920]  negative probability finding that positive probability the alignment with the market I hope that makes
# [01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.180]  sense yeah absolutely one of the things I did want to ask you before we wrap this up here and I
# [01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.480]  wanted to ask you about it last time that we sort of ran out of time then also just a couple
# [01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:07.300]  questions around brokerage you know you obviously the right man to ask so you know when starting out
# [01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:13.420]  opening a brokerage account can be somewhat of a daunting task what are a few things that people
# [01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:22.720]  should take into consideration before deciding on a broker okay so even though I'm affiliated
# [01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:33.480]  with a brokerage the brokerage is a way for me to fulfill a vision and eventually I want to get back
# [01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:38.560]  to prop using the brokerage being able to vet people out through the brokerage that's my goal
# [01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:44.540]  so I my comments are not going to be from the perspective you know take it or leave it
# [01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:50.100]  not from the perspective of hey come to stage five trading we are the best of the best
# [01:15:51.020 --> 01:16:00.980]  that's not the goal what I'm what I want to say is you want to be with a brokerage that one gives
# [01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:11.520]  you the largest as big a number of solutions to whatever trading method or software that you
# [01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:18.160]  want to use as possible stage five trading is an independent introducing broker in other words
# [01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:24.960]  we have relationships with multiple clearing firms providing many many many different types
# [01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:32.440]  and combinations of software and our brokers are trained to be able to find what it is you're trying
# [01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:40.480]  to do and to match you up with the lowest cost solution that actually fulfills your need you
# [01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:45.120]  know keeping costs down especially at the beginning is is quite important so we want you to connect
# [01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.300]  with a piece of software that gives you the data that you need without having to pay
# [01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:54.940]  additionally for data or to give you the software that you need the charts that you need without
# [01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:59.360]  having to pay additionally for charts and sometimes you have to pay for additional charts because
# [01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:07.240]  of the features that you're looking for so having a broker with a vast number of of outlets for
# [01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:14.160]  solutions is important the the big thing about brokerage and I wish they would change this at the
# [01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:20.640]  exchange level is the fact that people are out there advertising four hundred dollar or three
# [01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:28.740]  hundred dollar per contract margins that is just eight percent or seven percent of the required
# [01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:35.520]  exchange margin in futures okay so for the S&P the required exchange margin is around five
# [01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:43.800]  thousand dollars and that the five thousand dollars is really one to twenty leverage
# [01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:50.020]  compared to the value of the S&P 500 so you're already getting a lot of leverage
# [01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:54.460]  with the exchange margin and then you have these brokers out there that are giving you
# [01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:02.900]  ten times that so two hundred to one leverage and what that leverage is doing and people see
# [01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:07.480]  that advertised everywhere and so they think it's important that somehow they have to have
# [01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:13.600]  five hundred dollar margins we don't want to do that we have access to that and certain circumstances
# [01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:22.300]  and I manage risk for stage five as well as monitor traders I there have to be some really
# [01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:28.480]  exceptional circumstances some experience a lot of experience or you know good good streaks
# [01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.840]  or something that would merit someone getting that much leverage but we want to deliver people
# [01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:41.280]  we want you to trade at 50 percent of required margins we want you to slow down that's the thing
# [01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:47.320]  that most brokers don't do and I think eventually they will we want you to slow down we don't want
# [01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:52.840]  you to trade a ten lot on a five thousand dollar account you're gonna kill yourself within a
# [01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:57.820]  week or two and it's a waste of your time it's a waste of your money it's a waste of our time
# [01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:03.140]  and it's a lost opportunity for everybody including the trader we want to avoid that we think that's
# [01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:08.920]  a disaster it's kind of like handing a child a gut a loaded gun it's the outcome is not likely to be
# [01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:16.380]  good so broker who's concerned about you and understands traders and trading should be helping
# [01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:23.780]  you manage your risk and that's what we do best I believe on a on a best effort basis we want to
# [01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:29.420]  give you the tools to help manage your risk we want to deliver you we want you to start slow
# [01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:35.980]  you know five hundred dollar margins benefit the broker every broker wants you to come in and trade
# [01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:41.520]  ten lots and trade and trade and trade and churn because they get paid the broker only gets paid
# [01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:47.240]  when you trade live so they want to give you as much buying power as possible i'm not interested
# [01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:52.780]  in making money off of traders right now i'm interested in a longer term relationship which
# [01:19:52.780 --> 01:20:00.080]  includes the process of being in this community it's very important for me to have quality traders
# [01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:08.340]  as part of our chat community our weekly webinar community and helping us build a sustainable
# [01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:15.220]  long-term business and and and a lot of traders who you know start out trying to trade but their
# [01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:19.540]  job gets in the way it gives us an opportunity to to put them in our you know
# [01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:27.600]  S&P automated trading system a professionally created trading system or to invest their money
# [01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:34.400]  in managed programs managed funds that are fully regulated fully transparent things like
# [01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:40.120]  that i want to mention that you know investing in futures is not suitable for everybody but
# [01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:45.860]  at the same time we want to make sure we slow someone down so if you have a broker who is very
# [01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:53.780]  anxious to quote you will commission to give you your login and password and that broker is gone
# [01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:58.560]  and they're not doing anything for you they're not informing you they're not helping you
# [01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:05.040]  try better they're not intervening this is a typical structure that i see in our industry
# [01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:11.720]  and this is what we're changing we want it to be a more personal thing like name anyone in the chat
# [01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:18.860]  room out of 200 some odd people that are in there on a daily basis out of more than 2,000
# [01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:23.580]  accounts i'm able to tell you something about that person i'm able to tell you what their
# [01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:30.240]  general performance issues are you know are they chatty are they not focused are they focused
# [01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:37.400]  this this is what we want we want more of more and more of a community based structure
# [01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:43.500]  and if your broker could offer that great if they can't stage five is ready and willing you know
# [01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:49.280]  not to not to sound like a commercial but that's that's an important thing for me and that's by the
# [01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.020]  way is what is available to professionals when i went and started my prop shop at Advantage Futures
# [01:21:55.020 --> 01:22:05.820]  when i first started in 2004 that's what i got i got the senior vp making sure he knew who i was
# [01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:10.840]  knew the names of every one of my traders made sure that i got the best pricing i could and
# [01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:15.520]  made made sure we're comfortable while we rented office space within our office
# [01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:22.680]  had the best connections possible had the best servers possible it's you really have build loyalty
# [01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:29.120]  and and now all you need to focus on is the market rather than you know could i get a commission
# [01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.480]  somewhere else could i get better marching somewhere else maybe i can squeeze my broker for
# [01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:37.780]  five cents or ten cents it's irrelevant if you're hemorrhaging thousands of dollars every day because
# [01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:42.680]  you don't know how to manage your risk what difference is five cents or ten cents going to make
# [01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:48.320]  in your commission structure it makes no sense but that's what everybody's focus is on because
# [01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.520]  that's what everybody's ad everybody in the industry's advertising better commissions lower
# [01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:59.440]  commissions and lower margins but in a grand scheme of things if you want to be a professional
# [01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.420]  those are those are not those seem like a priority but they're not
# [01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:09.200]  so one of the things i'd just like you to clarify and sort of
# [01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:16.580]  make us clear on is you describe stage five as an independent introducing broker
# [01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:22.460]  how does that differ from a typical retail broker you know someone like e-trade or
# [01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:30.420]  you know just to name a name okay so let's take e-trade TD Ameritrade or thinker swim
# [01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:40.820]  they are they are for one offering you a large number of services so think of
# [01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:46.620]  i know this doesn't exist anymore and i'm dating myself a little bit think of
# [01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:54.900]  going to america online or prodigy or compu-serve to get an internet connection what you're plugging
# [01:23:54.900 --> 01:24:10.200]  into is a service that is built around giving you as much um providing you with as much as
# [01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:18.960]  independent broker you're generally getting direct market access um someone like trade station for
# [01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:28.060]  example has options has futures has forex or they don't have forex anymore actually uh and and has
# [01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:35.400]  equities and they're not exceptional at any one of those but they're giving you all of those
# [01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:41.740]  outlets i would not go to ticker swim or e-trade or scott trade or Ameritrade
# [01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:48.260]  as a professional i would go direct i would be seeking if i'm trading futures i would want to
# [01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:52.720]  go with a futures broker a direct broker if i'm trading equities i would want to go with a direct
# [01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:58.700]  equities broker and so on and so forth that's really the difference the connection you get from an
# [01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:07.200]  iib or an independent broker is not focused on what service what service can i get you to be
# [01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:15.060]  aligned with so that i can sell you on the service that i have so that's i am forcing you
# [01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:22.440]  to fit what i'm offering okay and in general much of what happens after the accounts opened is
# [01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.600]  automated you call because you're stuck in a position you get a computer that walks you through
# [01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:35.460]  the process and so on with us it is we tailored the service to you it's we're going in the opposite
# [01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:44.240]  direction so if erin wants to come in and he someone who has used cqg trader and wants to
# [01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:52.580]  power his you know multi charts using cqg i'm not going to sit here and say no you'll have to use
# [01:25:52.580 --> 01:26:00.520]  our thinker swim platform and that's it i am going to get you the cqg trader the same environment
# [01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:06.340]  the same charts and i'm going to make it work for you at the best possible cost that's what
# [01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:13.180]  your broker should be doing as opposed to forcing you to align yourself with what i have to offer
# [01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:17.600]  because it's hard enough to trade it's hard enough to align yourself with the market
#   now you have to learn a new platform and you have to learn a new process and figure out how to
#   get your charts to look the way they did that's not what we do we just reach out to
#   as many vendors as possible as many clearing firms as possible and try to provide the solution
# [01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:42.940]  if we don't our brokers are required to basically say we can't do it we're sorry but here's the number
# [01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:48.980]  of someone who can even if we don't make money on it you're off on your way to getting what you
# [01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:55.500]  need you need to have access to equities plus four x plus futures well where a future is only
# [01:26:55.500 --> 01:27:01.400]  broker here's here's where you should probably go you know and and that's that's really the
# [01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:10.060]  difference as opposed to a giant kind of organization that is has already set its course kind of like
# [01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:17.360]  a big ship and it's hard for it to turn with with the the the technology and what's being offered
# [01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:23.260]  it's hard for it to integrate that until much much later we are very malleable because we're
# [01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:29.140]  small we have access to all these pieces and we don't own or or maintain any of the software
# [01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:35.200]  it's someone else's software we just make it available to you that's all very good very good
# [01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:42.720]  okay all right well let's find this down so ft where is the best place to go if you listen
